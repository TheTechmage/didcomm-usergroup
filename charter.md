# Charter

## Purpose

The DIDComm User Group is tasked with serving community needs around DIDComm that fall outside DIDComm spec creation concerns.

## Scope of work

- Operation of DIDComm.org
- Maintenance of community resources such as a DIDComm Handbook (explaining DIDComm implementations, techniques, and best practices)
- Coordinating the creation, refinement, and publication of application-level DIDComm Protocols. This includes facilitating publication/announcement for protocols designed elsewhere; anybody can publish on didcomm.org, whether it is open source or not.
- Raise discovered spec issues to spec group.

## Out of Scope

- Additions to specification content.
- Proposing solutions to spec problems.
- Discussion of anything that requires IPR protection.

## Group Format

This group is NOT an IPR Protected group, and does not require DIF membership.

- Two chairs to facilitate meetings and protect against IPR conversations.
- [didcomm.org repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identitiy/didcomm.org) conversations and issues
- Meetings (on a regular schedule, plus extras for special topics)
- Asynchronous communication via Github issues/discussions, [Discord](https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb), [email](https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup), etc.
- Formal proposals about changing our process or any content we publish are managed via PRs. Procedures for approving and merging PRs are described in maintainer rules [for this repo](maintainer-guide.md) and [for the didcomm.org repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm.org/blob/main/docs/maintainer-guide.md).
- Group decisions that aren't handled by PR will be proposed on Discord and decided by simple majority of active group participants.
