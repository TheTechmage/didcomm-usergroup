### &lt;goal, e.g., "follow up on"&gt; topic X
Alice was assigned to ___. Can you report, @Alice?

### Discuss Problem X

@Bob wants to socialize an idea about how to solve. Link to Bob's recorded presentation: http://example.com/preso1. Link to test data: http://example.com/test-data.

>**Proposed closure**: discuss on chat and revisit in two weeks, when our thinking may be mature enough to vote.

### Vote on Section Y of Book

Two different framings of this section have been proposed, in competing PRs [[1](http://example.com/PR1)] and [[2](http://example.com/PR2)].

>**Proposed closure**: Visit each PR and **vote** in favor of either zero or one of them (and against what you don't like). Vote closes in 3 days.

### Brainstorm Z

We need a good way to manage and track examples. Github gists? Can we automate the testing of examples, so we get an effect like the one in the GFM spec?

>**Proposed closure**: accumulate ideas for 1 week on chat.
