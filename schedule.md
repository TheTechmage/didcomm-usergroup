# Schedule

We hold a [drop-in meeting called an UnSync](https://hackmd.io/@dhh1128/Sk5_Gb2J9) every 2 weeks on Wednesday, for 12 hours, beginning at 1100 UTC. Thatâ€™s 2000 Tokyo / 1700 Delhi / 1200 Central Europe / 0600 Eastern / 0400 Pacific. If you make yourself an appointment, start it on 23 Feb 2022 to get the on/off weeks right.

The meeting is held on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb).

The agenda for our next meeting, and an archive of previous meetings, is stored in [`/meetings/`](meetings/).
