# Schedule

We used to hold a [drop-in meeting called an UnSync](https://hackmd.io/@dhh1128/Sk5_Gb2J9) every 2 weeks. However, we've ramped up our activities and now have a Zoom meeting instead. It is held on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Monday of every month, at 1 PM in the Mountain timezone from North America. (On the 1st Monday, DIF uses the same slot for the DIDComm Working Group, which does more formal work with the spec.)

Timezones that have daylight savings adjustments can just add or subtract an offset and will mostly get the time right, except for occasional hiccups from variations in the daylight savings transitions. Our our meeting time is at 9 pm Central Europe time, for example. Locales that don't use daylight savings should compute the time from the reference timezone, and will have two different offsets during the year.

One convenient way to get calendar appointments is to add the Google calendar for decentralized.identity@gmail.com to your own calendar sources. Otherwise, you can manually add the Zoom meeting.

We also invite you to join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/eNN4Wns6Jb), which is always active. Agendas for our meetings are often kept inline, in that chat channel. Some old agendas are archived in [`/meetings/`](meetings/).
