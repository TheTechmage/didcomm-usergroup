# DIDComm User Group

This repo is the home for content that embodies the processes and topics of the DIDComm User Group. PRs are gladly entertained.

You can interact with us on our Discord channel, https://discord.com/channels/900385725462229022/911224279885033533. Membership is open. Email one of the chairs of the group (currently [Daniel Harmdan](mailto:daniel.hardman@gmail.com) or [Daniel Bluhm](mailto:daniel.bluhm@indicio.tech)) if you want an invite.

We hold a [drop-in meeting called an UnSync](https://hackmd.io/@dhh1128/Sk5_Gb2J9) every 2 weeks on Wednesday, for 12 hours, beginning at 1100 UTC. Thatâ€™s 2000 Tokyo / 1700 Delhi / 1200 Central Europe / 0600 Eastern / 0400 Pacific. If you make yourself an appointment, start it on 23 Feb 2022 to get the on/off weeks right.

We also maintain didcomm.org through [its repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm.org).
